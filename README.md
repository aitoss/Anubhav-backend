Anubhav is a platform developed for AITians to read & share encounters of various interviews. Including interviews of big giants like Amazon, Google & Microsoft. This will surely help the upcoming batches of AIT.

* Portal Link - https://anubhav.aitoss.club 
* Front-End Repository - https://github.com/aitoss/Anubhav-frontend


# Highlights
* Anyone can share his/her experience of an interview to help students.
* Students who know someone and want his/her interview experience can request by providing a few details.
* Writing anonymously is also possible on Anubhav.
* In the future, we would extend this platform more than just Interview Experiences by adding more helpful features.

# Requirements:

* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Postman
* Studio3T or MongoDB Compass - Managing DB
